This project is my second coding project developed during my first year at university. Very similar to my first project. It was created when I had little familiarity with object-oriented programming. There might still be some errors present. I used Microsoft Access as the database for this project. You can download and run the program directly.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- Microsoft Access
